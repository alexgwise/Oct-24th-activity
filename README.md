saturday morning practice
My name is Alex Wise. I lead a finance operations team for a large healthcare company. I'm not looking to make a
career change at this time. I'm simply trying to sharpen my skills and be a better leader for my team. I'm excited
to learn some of the disruptive technologies in the FinTech landscape.
